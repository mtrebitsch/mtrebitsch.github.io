I am :abbr:`currently (since 2019)` a post-doctoral `STRUCTURES`_ fellow in Heidelberg, working jointly at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie (`MPIA`_) with Annalisa Pillepich and at the Zentrum für Astronomie (`ZAH/ITA`_) with Ralf Klessen and Simon Glover.
Before this, I defended my PhD in 2016 at the `Observatoire de Lyon`_ under the supervision of Jérémy Blaizot, and then moved to the `Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris`_, where I worked with Marta Volonteri.

My research interests embrace various aspects of the **formation of galaxies at high redshift**. I spend most of my time thinking about the **Epoch of Reionization**: this correspond to the first billion years of the Universe, during which massive stars and active galactic nuclei (*AGN*) shine and ionize the surrounding Intergalactic Medium (*IGM*). I focus on the following broad questions:

- How do early galaxies form their stars, and how are they affected by the subsequent feedback?
- How do massive black holes at the centre of galaxies grow and power AGN, and how does this impact their host?
- How much ionizing radiation is produced by these galaxies, and how much of it escapes to reionize the Universe?

I address these questions using cosmological simulations, mostly with the :abbr:`AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)` code RAMSES_, and its radiation-hydrodynamics RAMSES-RT.

.. During my thesis, I tried to model how the hydrogen-ionising radiation (λ ≤ 912 Å) emitted by massive stars in star-forming galaxies escapes into the inter-galactic medium. This is thought to be the mechanism responsible for the reionisation of the Universe that happened between *z* ~ 15 and *z* ~ 6 -- the *Epoch of Reionisation*. For this, I perform high resolution cosmological simulations with the :abbr:`AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)` code RAMSES_, and its radiation-hydrodynamics RAMSES-RT.

.. Since I arrived in Paris, I am interested in understanding how supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies coevolve with their hosts. More specifically, I focus on how the feedback from AGN and supernovae affects the gas in and around high-*z* galaxies. We have :abbr:`recently (in 2018)` published `a paper <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2018MNRAS.478.5607T&link_type=ABSTRACT>`_ showing how, in dwarf galaxies, supernova feedback is so strong that it interrupts the fueling of the central black hole.

Together with a group of collaborators between the IAP, Lyon, Oxford and Yonsei University, I recently started a large simulation project called Obelisk to model the formation of a protocluster until the peak of cosmic star formation (around *z* ~ 2). There will be more details soon on a dedicated page…

.. Before that, I modeled the Lyman-α radiation emitted by gas infalling on giant galaxies to understand observations of so-called "Lyman-α blobs".
